Naming conventions:

> camelCase - variables, functions, properties inside objects, file names
> PascalCase - component names, class names, types etc
> kebab-case - file names, css classes, ids
> snake_case - not common in js

React rules:

- Each JSX expression must have one parent element, which means if you try to return multiple elements, React throws error

- Every JSX tag needs to be closed. You can use self-closing tags for elements that don't have children, eg <img src="url" />

Component:

- In React, a component is essentially a JavaScript function or class that returns JSX (JavaScript XML), a synatx extension that allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. Components are the building blocks of any React application, allowing for the creation of complex and interactive user iterfaces through the assembly of isolated, reusable pieces.

- You can also use .js extension with React.js components but it's recommended to use .jsx to differentiate between regular JavaScript Files and React.js components.

There are two ways to create components in React.js:

> Class based components: This is how components were created before functional components.

> Functional components: This is modern and recommended way of writing React.js components.
